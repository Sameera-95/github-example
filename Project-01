Finding the best business category and location for startups in Colombo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Sri Lanka with the current trend for startups, most people are willing to own their own business. 
But only some of them are succeeding. One of the reason for faliure is the competition in business categories 
and access of locations. When a startup is initializing stakeholders have to do a market research and look for 
optimum business category that they should startup with, also where should the business located. 
This project is focused on specially entrepreneurs in Colombo, looking for opportunities. 
In this project I will address following issues,

01. What is the best type of business for startups in Colombo?
02. How the business categories are located in Colombo?
03. What are the locations that lack of certain business type?

I will scrape location data from foursquare for this project. Namely, location data of cafetarias, restuarants, shopping 
centers, etc. in Colombo. Also in order to determine access for locations I will add available transportation faciliteis 
in Colombo for the data set. Using those data I will try to asnwer above questions.
